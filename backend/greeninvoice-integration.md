## Payment Flow

### 1. Customer Initiates Payment
- Customer fills cart and clicks "Proceed to Payment"
- Frontend opens GreenInvoicePayment component
- Customer fills in personal information

### 2. Invoice Creation
- Frontend calls `/api/greeninvoice/create-invoice`
- Backend validates input and creates invoice via GreenInvoice API
- GreenInvoice returns payment URL and invoice details

### 3. Payment Processing
- Customer is redirected to GreenInvoice payment page
- GreenInvoice handles payment through their Cardcom plugin
- Customer enters credit card details securely

### 4. Payment Completion
- GreenInvoice processes payment and sends webhook
- Backend receives webhook and updates order status
- Customer receives confirmation email from GreenInvoice

- Error rates and types
- Webhook processing success

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. "GreenInvoice configuration missing"
**Cause**: Environment variables not set
**Solution**: Check that `GREENINVOICE_API_KEY` and `GREENINVOICE_USER_ID` are configured

#### 2. "Invoice creation failed"
**Cause**: Invalid request data or API error
**Solution**: Check request payload and GreenInvoice API logs

#### 3. "Payment webhook not received"
**Cause**: Webhook URL not configured in GreenInvoice
**Solution**: Configure webhook URL in GreenInvoice settings

#### 4. "Customer email not received"
**Cause**: Email template not configured
**Solution**: Set up email templates in GreenInvoice

### Debug Steps
1. Check backend logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify environment variables are loaded correctly
3. Test API endpoints with curl or Postman
4. Check GreenInvoice dashboard for invoice status
5. Verify webhook URL is accessible
